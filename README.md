# tapis-vaultbackup
Backup program for Hashicorp Vault instances

## Build the tapis-vaultbackup JAR
Using Java 17 or higher (Note: will build with java 15 or higher but cannot be certain it will maintain functionality), issue "mvn clean install" in
the top-level directory of the cloned tapis-vaultbackup repo. The tapis-vaultbackup-1.0.jar file will be created (with the version number subject to
change).
